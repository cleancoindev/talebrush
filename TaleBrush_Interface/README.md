# Introduction

TaleBrush uses a line sketching interaction for intuitive control and sensemaking of story generation with GPT-based language models.
TaleBrush allows uses to control the protagonist's fortune. 

You will also need an ML backend to fully run the function.

Forked from [Flask React Boilerplate](https://travis-ci.org/YaleDHLab/flask-react-boilerplate)

## Dependencies

To install the boilerplate dependencies, you can run:

```
npm install --no-optional
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Quickstart

Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the api with the following command:

```bash
npm run production
```

That will start the server on port 7082.
